# Auto Checkpoint System

## Overview

The auto-checkpoint system automatically creates Git commits and tags whenever major refactors, migrations, or feature additions are completed successfully.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Triggering**: When I complete major changes and confirm the app builds without errors, I'll automatically run the checkpoint system
2. **Git Operations**: Creates commits, tags, and pushes to remote repository
3. **Documentation**: Updates `docs/CHANGELOG_CHECKPOINTS.md` with checkpoint details
4. **Error Handling**: Notifies both you and GPT-5 if any errors occur

## Manual Usage

You can also create checkpoints manually:

```bash
# Create checkpoint with custom description
npm run checkpoint "Your description here"

# Or run the script directly
node scripts/auto-checkpoint.js "Your description here"
```

## Checkpoint Format

- **Tags**: `v0.[incremental-number]-auto`
- **Commits**: `Auto-checkpoint: [description]`
- **Changelog**: Includes timestamp, description, commit hash, and rollback command

## Rollback Commands

```bash
# Roll back to specific checkpoint
git checkout v0.1-auto

# See all available checkpoints
git tag -l "*auto"

# See checkpoint details
git show v0.1-auto
```

## System Status

âœ… **Auto checkpoint system is configured and ready**

The system will automatically trigger when:
- Major refactors are completed
- Migrations are finished  
- Large feature sets are added
- App builds without errors after significant changes
