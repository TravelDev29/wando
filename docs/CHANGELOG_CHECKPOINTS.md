# Auto Checkpoint Changelog

This file tracks automatic checkpoints created during development when major changes are completed successfully.

## Checkpoint System

The system automatically creates Git commits and tags when:
- Major refactors are completed
- Migrations are finished
- Large feature sets are added
- App builds without errors after significant changes

## Checkpoints

## Usage

To roll back to any checkpoint:

git checkout v0.[tag-number]-auto
```

To see all available checkpoints:
```bash
git tag -l "*auto"
```
